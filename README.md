# HOI-Detection-CAD120-with-knowledge-graph
(This repository is under development)

Code for various methods implemented for HOI detection : 
1) Using only pretrained (on charades) I3D features visual features only.
2) Using CAD120 precomputed spatial pose features only.
3) Using combined visual-pose features by fusing I3D features with pose heatmaps.
